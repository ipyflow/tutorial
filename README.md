# nbsafety getting started

Install
-------
```bash
pip install nbsafety
```

If using JupyterLab, we highly recommend installing the companion extension:
```bash
pip install jupyterlab  # if not already installed
jupyter labextension install jupyterlab-nbsafety  # optional but highly recommended
```


Running
-------
To run an `nbsafety` kernel, select "Python 3
(nbsafety)" from the list of notebook types in Jupyter's "New" dropdown
dialogue.  For JupyterLab, similarly select "Python 3 (nbsafety)" from the list
of available kernels in the Launcher tab.
