The NBSafety tutorial is presented as a set of interactive notebooks.
Please download and open each of the following notebooks
(or clone this repo), and follow the instructions contained within.
1. [Overview](/notebooks/nbsafety-overview.ipynb)
2. [Exercises](/notebooks/nbsafety-exercise.ipynb)

See below for brief installation and usage instructions.

Install
-------
```bash
pip install nbsafety
```

If using JupyterLab, we highly recommend installing the companion extension:
```bash
jupyter labextension install jupyterlab-nbsafety
```

If you are in a hurry, you can copy+paste the following into a terminal:
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nbsafety-project/tutorial/master/setup.sh)"
```


Running
-------
To run an `nbsafety` kernel, select "Python 3
(nbsafety)" from the list of notebook types in Jupyter's "New" dropdown
dialogue.  For JupyterLab, similarly select "Python 3 (nbsafety)" from the list
of available kernels in the Launcher tab.
